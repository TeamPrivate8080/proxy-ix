To ensure online privacy and support open proxies, we have developed the largest open-source project for proxy scraping and scanning.

<br>
Project is still in beta, more performant updates soon
<br>
You are responsible for scraping and monitoring proxies yourself.

<br><br>
How to run: <br>
python required<br>
python3 main.py -socks5<br>
python3 main.py -socks4<br>
python3 main.py -http<br>
If it gives error for required packages simply install them<br>
